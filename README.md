# dev_zodiac_app
A project developed during the Prefect Associate Certification Course to explore Prefectâ€™s tasks, flows, subflows, pause flow runs, and user inputs. This satirical horoscope generator pauses to collect a star sign and job title, scrapes a daily horoscope, and rewrites it humorously for developers using the OpenAI API.
